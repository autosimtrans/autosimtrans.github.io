                    <p id="reftxt" style="background-color:#74DDFE">of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. As President Obama said in Seoul last month, “we’ve upheld the basic bargain of the NPT. Countries with nuclear weapons, like the United States and Russia, will move towards disarmament. Countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them. And all countries can have access to peaceful nuclear energy.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has continued to play an essential role in implementing safeguards and promoting the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy. The combination of an NPT safeguards agreement and an additional protocol is widely recognized as the standard for strengthened IAEA safeguards. To date, 115 States, including the United States of America, have brought into force an additional protocol granting to the IAEA expanded rights of access to information and sites. We continue to seek partners in the effort to expand and accelerate IAEA activities in order to strengthen the Agency’s ability to detect and deter undeclared nuclear activities. In 2011, the Security Council adopted resolution 1977 (2011), which extended the mandate of the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) for an unprecedented 10 years. The 1540 Committee’s work to help States prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non- State actors is a crucial part of the international non-proliferation regime. The United States fully supports 1540 implementation efforts and made a voluntary contribution of $3 million last year to promote the work. Finally, the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit, held in Washington, D.C., was followed by a second summit last month. More than 50 heads of State met in Seoul and reaffirmed their commitment to combat nuclear terrorism and increase nuclear security. The actions and commitments undertaken by participating States are being translated into tangible steps to protect against nuclear terrorism. The United States is also strengthening global non-proliferation and disarmament efforts. The 2010 United States Nuclear Posture Review outlined our approach to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and pursuing the goal of a world without such weapons. Through the Posture Review we announced that the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations. We also emphasized our collective interest in ensuring that the record of more than six decades of nuclear non-use continues forever. The New START agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation, which entered into force on 5 February 2011, is being implemented successfully. The Treaty illustrates yet again the strong commitment of the United States to meeting its disarmament obligations. When the Treaty is fully implemented, the deployed strategic nuclear forces of the United States and Russia will reach their lowest level since the 1950s. The rigorous provisions of the New START agreement testify to the importance of transparency and effective verification in providing predictability and stability in international relations. Continuing the process of engagement by the five permanent members of the Security Council (P-5) established through the 2009 London and 2011 Paris P-5 conferences, the United States will host a P-5 conference in Washington, D.C., later this year to continue discussions on verification, transparency and confidence-building measures. The P-5 process now under way expands the long-standing United States-Russia nuclear disarmament dialogue into an ongoing process of P-5 engagement on issues related to nuclear disarmament, consistent with our obligations under article VI of the NPT and our commitments under the 2010 NPT Action Plan. The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is also an essential step towards a world without nuclear weapons. The United States remains committed to working towards our ratification of the Treaty and its entry into force. We continue to maintain our voluntary moratorium on nuclear explosive testing, which went into effect two decades ago. We call upon all States to refrain from nuclear explosive testing. Despite those many multilateral and national efforts, much work remains to be done. We must continue to strengthen global nuclear non- proliferation, disarmament and security efforts. We cannot let our guard down. Certain countries continue to pursue nuclear-weapon capabilities, in violation of Security Council resolutions and contrary to the clearly expressed will of the international community. The dangers we face and the price of complacency remain much too high. We cannot, for example, allow the NPT to be weakened by tolerating non-compliance with its requirements or violations of international safeguards agreements. The implications of any case of non-compliance, whether by North Korea or Iran, concern more than just the offending country and its neighbours. Every violation of the NPT has the potential, if left unchecked, to erode confidence in the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. We cannot, and we will not, let that happen. Beginning negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty is the next logical step in nuclear arms control. It is therefore a great disappointment that, due to one country, the Conference on Disarmament has been unable to agree to move forward. The Conference should agree to commence negotiations without further delay. We must also sharpen our commitment to nuclear safety and security. The terrible accident at the Fukushima plant last year was a reminder of our shared vulnerability as much of the world looks increasingly to nuclear power to fuel economic growth and development. The choice safely to develop and maintain nuclear power is, and should remain, a national one. However, we will continue strongly to support international efforts, led primarily by the IAEA, to facilitate better nuclear safety training and cooperation and to improve accident response capacities. The United States believes that it has a moral responsibility to lead and act now, in cooperation with members of the Council and the international community, to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. Today’s meeting and draft presidential statement mark a milestone on that path. As President Obama remarked in Seoul last month, “no one nation can do this alone.” I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council. After consultations among members of the Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on their behalf: “The Security Council reaffirms that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security. “The Security Council remains gravely concerned about the threat of terrorism, and the risk that non-State actors may acquire, develop, traffic in or use weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. “The Security Council reaffirms the need for all Member States to comply fully with their obligations and fulfil their commitments in relation to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. “The Security Council reaffirms its support for the multilateral treaties whose aim it is to eliminate or prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and the importance for all States Parties to those treaties to implement them fully in order to promote international stability. “The Security Council reaffirms resolution 1540 (2004), which affirms that States shall take effective measures to prevent non-State actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and to establish domestic controls to prevent proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, their means of delivery and related materials, recognizes States’ progress in implementing resolution 1540 (2004), endorses the work carried out by the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), and, in that regard, recalls resolution 1977 (2011), which extends the mandate of the 1540 Committee for 10 years.</p><br>
