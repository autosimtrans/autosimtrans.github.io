                    <p id="reftxt" style="background-color:#74DDFE">I wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his briefing. 	With increasing globalization, the links and exchanges among countries have grown ever closer as the global movement of materials and people accelerates. At the same time, the problem of illicit cross-border trafficking and movement, exemplified by arms proliferation, drug trafficking and the spread of terrorism, is ever more serious. Lately, arms proliferation in West Africa and the Sahel region and the turbulence in Mali have raised widespread concern. Granted, arms proliferation in the region has its own history, but recent regional conflicts have aggravated it. 	I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize three points related to strengthening international cooperation in fighting illicit cross-border trafficking and movement. 	First, border management falls within the sovereignty of Member States. National Governments shoulder the primary responsibility for strengthening their border and customs control and for preventing and fighting all types of illicit cross-border trafficking and movement. We hope that countries, in accordance with relevant United Nations and Security Council resolutions, will fulfil their obligations under relevant international conventions and international law, improve domestic legislation, strengthen interdepartmental coordination and cooperation, increase law enforcement capabilities and take practical steps to strengthen border management. 	Secondly, we support international cooperation in fighting illicit cross-border trafficking and movement. Such cooperation should focus on assisting countries in need of capacity-building. In the meantime, countries differ from one another in their border management practices. While providing assistance, the international community should fully respect the national circumstances, desires and choices of countries receiving aid, adhere to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States. 	Thirdly, it is essential to bring into full play the advantages of the various United Nations agencies so as to create synergy. In assisting Member States to strengthen their border management capacities, it is advisable to fully take advantage of existing United Nations agencies, including, for instance, by formulating best practices. The various United Nations agencies should, in accordance with their respective terms of reference and specialties, properly allocate tasks and strengthen their coordination. The Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. It should therefore focus its attention on illicit cross-border trafficking and movement that threaten international peace and security, and avoid duplication of labour and disrupting the functions of other United Nations bodies. </p><br>

With the deepening globalization, the links and exchanges amongst countries are getting ever closer with global movement of materials and personnel showing an accelerating trend. At the same time, the problem of illicit cross-border trafficking and movement, exemplified by arms proliferation, drugs trafficking and spreading terrorism, is ever more serious. Lately, the arms proliferation in Western Africa and the Sahel region as well as the turbulence in Mali have attracted broad concerns. Granted, the arms proliferation in the region has its historical recency. Nevertheless the recent regional conflicts have aggravated it. I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize three points, uh, strengthening international cooperation coming together to fight against illicit cross-border trafficking and movement. Firstly, border management falls within the sovereignty of Member States. National governments shoulder the primary responsibility for strengthening their border and customs control and for preventing and fighting against all manner of illicit cross-border trafficking and movement. We hope countries will, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN and this Council, fulfill their obligations under the relevant international conventions and international law, improve domestic laws and legislations, strengthen interdepartmental coordination and cooperation, beef up law informan- enforcement capabilities and practically strengthen border management. Secondly, we support international cooperation in fighting illicit cross-border trafficking and movement. The cooperation should be focused on assisting the needy countries in their capacity-building. In the meantime, countries differ from one another in their border management practices. While providing assistance, the international community should fully respect the national circumstances as well as the will and the choices of receiving countries, stick to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Member States. Thirdly, it is essential to bring into full play the advantages of the various UN agencies so as to create synergy. In assisting the Member States in strengthening their border management and capacity building, it is advisable to fully take advantage of the roles of the existing UN agencies, including, for instance, in formulating best practices. The various UN agencies should, in accordance with their respective terms of reference and specialties, properly divide up the labor and strengthen their coordination. The Security Council should have the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. As such, it should focus its attention on illicit cross-border trafficking and movement that threatens international peace and security, and avoid duplication of labour or disrupting the proper function of other bodies. Thank you Madam President.  Representative of China for his statement, and I now give the floor to the representative of Germany.</textarea>
