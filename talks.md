## Keynote Speakers

Following the tradition of our previous workshops, we will have two sets of keynote speakers: 3 from simultaneous translation, and 2 from human interpretation research. We hope this workshop will greatly increase the communication and cross-fertilization between the two fields.

##### Simultaneous Translation Speakers:

- [Juan Pino](https://ai.facebook.com/people/juan-pino/), Research Scientist, Facebook Research, USA 
- [Trevor Cohn](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/), Professor, The University of Melbourne, Australia 


##### Human Interpretation Speakers:

- [Weiwei Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiwei-wang-3610a532/?originalSubdomain=cn), Associate Professor, Research Fellow, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, China
- [Wallace Chen](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/people/wallace-chen-chenruiqing), Professor; Program Head, Middlebury Institute of International Studies, USA 

We have 4 confirmed speakers, and one speaker is female (Weiwei Wang).
