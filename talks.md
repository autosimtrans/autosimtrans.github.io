## Keynote Speakers

Following the tradition of our previous workshops, we will have two sets of keynote speakers: 3 from simultaneous translation, and 2 from human interpretation research. We hope this workshop will greatly increase the communication and cross-fertilization between the two fields.

##### Simultaneous Translation Speakers:
