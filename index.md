## 1 Overview

Simultaneous translation, which performs translation concurrently with the source speech, is widely useful in many scenarios such as international conferences, negotiations, press releases, legal proceedings, and medicine. It combines the AI technologies of machine translation (MT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), is becoming a cutting-edge research field. As an emerging and interdisciplinary field, simultaneous translation faces many great challenges.

To promote the development in this field, we successfully held the first workshop on simultaneous translation at ACL 2020. We attracted 94 registered participants. We invited 6 keynote speakers, 4 from simultaneous translation, and 2 from human interpretation research. We also held a shared task on Chinese-English simultaneous translation and released an open dataset Baidu Speech Translation Corpus ([BSTC](https://ai.baidu.com/broad/subordinate?dataset=bstc)) for open research, which covers speeches in a wide range of domains, including IT, economy, culture, biology, arts, etc. The shared task attracted 227 participants. However, affected by COVID-19, only a few submitted the results. The workshop also received 8 research paper submissions, with 5 accepted. The videos of invited talks were viewed 311 times (51.8 per talk). The videos for the 6 contributed talks were viewed 143 times (23.8 per talk). The peak zoom attendance was 25.

We have experiences of running a virtual workshop. All the talks and presentations are pre-recorded. We also run live Q&As for each session to let all the speakers and attendees for further discussion.

Since simultaneous translation is an active area in AI community, we propose to organize our second workshop in 2021. The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in machine translation, speech processing, and human interpretation, to discuss recent advances and open challenges of simultaneous translation. including:

- Simultaneous translation paradigms: traditional pipeline (ASR-MT-TTS) or end-to-end (speech-speech); • Translation models: robust, high quality, and low latency;
- Data resources: large and high-quality corpora for training simultaneous translation systems.
- Evaluation methods: metrics to evaluate the translation quality and time latency;
- Computer Aided Interpretation (CAI): improve the efficiency and quality of human interpreters;



## 2 Keynote Speakers

Following the tradition of our first workshop, we will have two sets of keynote speakers: 3 from simultaneous translation, and 1 from human interpretation research. We hope this workshop will greatly increase the communication and cross-fertilization between the two fields.


##### Simultaneous Translation Speakers:

- [Will Lewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-lewis-24b39511), Affiliate Faculty, University of Washington, and Former Principal PM Architect, Microsoft Research, USA (confirmed)
- [Lucia Specia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.specia), Professor, Imperial College London, UK (confirmed)
- [Liang Huang](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/), Assoc. Professor, Oregon State & Distinguished Scientist, Baidu Research, USA (confirmed)


##### Human Interpretation Speaker (member of AIIC):


- [Hong Jiang](http://traserver.tra.cuhk.edu.hk/en/people_detail.php?cate=Lecturers&ppid=52), Sr. Lecturer, Dept. of Translation, Chinese University of Hong Kong, China (confirmed)

We have all 4 speakers confirmed, and 2 out of 4 are female (Lucia and Hong).


## 3 Diversity

As in our first workshop, we have made efforts to promote diversity in our invited speakers, organizers, and PC. 2 out of 4 invited speakers are female, so are 2 out of 6 organizers, and 7 out of 20 PC members.

## 4 Estimated Number of Attendees

Based on the fact that our first workshop (at ACL 2020) attracted 94 registrations, we estimate the number of partici- pants for our second workshop to be around 80–120.

## 5 Preferred Venues

We prefer our second workshop to appear at ACL 2021 or EMNLP 2021. But we have a special request. In 2020, both IWSLT and our workshop were held at ACL 2020, and there was a small overlap between the two workshops in terms of topics. After consultation with the organizers of IWSLT (Alex Waibel, Satoshi Nakamura, et al.) and participants of both workshops, we conclude that it is probably better to have these two workshops at separate conferences. Therefore, we’d appreciate if the ACL/EMNLP Workshop Chairs can take this into consideration. If IWSLT is going to be assigned to ACL 2021, please consider our workshop at EMNLP 2021, and vice versa.


## 6 Virtual Conference
We are well prepared if our second workshop has to be a virtual conference just like our first workshop at ACL 2020. In fact, we think it would be easier for the invited speakers when no travel is needed. The only major challenge for running a virtual workshop is time zone coordination, as we have participants from Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In 2020, we organized our first workshop into two sessions:


Session | Pacific (PDT) | Eastern (EDT) | Europe (CET) | East Asia (GMT+8) | Speakers
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
#1 |early morning<br> 7:30–9:30am | late morning<br>10:30am–12:30pm | late afternoon<br>4:30-6:30pm | late evening / night<br>10:30pm-12:30am | Americas/Europe
#2 |late afternoon<br>3-6:30pm |  early evening<br>6-9:30pm|  night time<br>12-3:30am|  early morning<br>6-9:30am|Asia|

As you can see, we tried our best to balance among the four time zones where most of our participants are from. The only suboptimal slot is Session #2 for European attendees, which was their night time. And we placed the talks into the slots that are most convenient for the speakers, e.g., we scheduled speakers from North America to Session #1 and those from Asia to Session #2. For our second workshop, we plan to have it based on this arrangement.



## 7 Shared Task


As we did in our first workshop, we plan to continue to organize the simultaneous translation shared tasks on Chinese- English and English-Spanish (or French). We will provide open datasets and evaluation environment. Participants are asked to submit their system description and show demonstration on the workshop. We will enlarge the corpus and extend the language pairs for our second workshop.
