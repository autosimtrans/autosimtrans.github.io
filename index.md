## 1 Description of the Workshop and Results from the First and the Second Workshop

##### (attached with ACL 2020 and NAACL 2021 respectively)

Simultaneous translation, which performs translation concurrently with the source speech, is widely useful in many scenarios such as international conferences, negotiations, press releases, legal proceedings, and medicine.
It combines the AI technologies of machine translation (MT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and is rapidly becoming a cutting-edge research field.
 As an emerging and interdisciplinary field, simultaneous translation faces many great challenges.

To promote the development in this field, we successfully held the first and the second workshop on simultaneous translation at ACL 2020 and NAACL 2021 respectively.
We attracted 94 registered participants in 2020 and 96 registered participants in 2021.
In the past two years, we invited 10 keynote speakers, 7 from simultaneous translation, and 3 from human interpretation research.  We also held a shared task on Chinese-English simultaneous translation and released an open dataset Baidu Speech Translation Corpus ([BSTC](https://ai.baidu.com/broad/subordinate?dataset=bstc)) for open research, which covers speeches in a wide range of domains, including IT, economy, culture, biology, arts, etc.  The shared task attracted a total of 525 participants in the past two workshops (227 at ACL 2020 and 298 at NAACL 2021).
The workshop also received 14 research paper submissions, with 11 accepted.
The peak zoom attendance was 25 at ACL 2020 and 31 at NAACL 2021.

We have experiences of running a virtual workshop. All the talks and presentations are pre-recorded. We also run live Q\&As for each session to let all the speakers and attendees for further discussion.

 Since simultaneous translation is an active and growing area in AI community, we propose to organize the third workshop in 2022. The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in machine translation, speech processing, and human interpretation, to discuss recent advances and open challenges of simultaneous translation, including:

- Simultaneous translation paradigms: traditional pipeline (ASR-MT-TTS) or end-to-end (speech-speech);
- Translation models: robust, high quality, and low latency;
- Data resources: large and high-quality corpora for training simultaneous translation systems.
- Evaluation methods: metrics to evaluate the translation quality and time latency;
- Computer Aided Interpretation (CAI): improve the efficiency and quality of human interpreters;

## 2 Keynote Speakers

Following the tradition of our previous workshops, we will have two sets of keynote speakers: 3 from simultaneous translation, and 2 from human interpretation research. We hope this workshop will greatly increase the communication and cross-fertilization between the two fields.

##### Simultaneous Translation Speakers:

- [Juan Pino](https://ai.facebook.com/people/juan-pino/), Research Scientist, Facebook Research, USA (confirmed)
- [Trevor Cohn](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/), Professor, The University of Melbourne, Australia (confirmed)
- [Tao Qin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/), Senior Principal Research Manager, MSRA, China (pending)

##### Human Interpretation Speakers:

- [Weiwei Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiwei-wang-3610a532/?originalSubdomain=cn), Associate Professor, Research Fellow, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, China (confirmed)
- [Wallace Chen](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/people/wallace-chen-chenruiqing), Professor; Program Head, Middlebury Institute of International Studies, USA (confirmed)

We have 4 confirmed speakers out of 5, and one speaker is female (Weiwei Wang).

## 3 Diversity

As in our first workshop, we have made efforts to promote diversity in our invited speakers, organizers, and PC. 1 out of 5 invited speakers are female, so are 2 out of 6 organizers, and 7 out of 20 PC members.

## 4 Estimated Number of Attendees

Based on the fact that our previous workshops (at ACL 2020 and NAACL 2021) attracted 94 and 96 registrations, we estimate the number of participants for our third workshop to be around 80--120.

## 5 Preferred Venues

We prefer our third workshop to appear at ACL 2022 or EMNLP 2022.

## 6 Virtual Conference

We are well prepared if our third workshop has to be a virtual conference just like our previous workshops at ACL 2020 and NAACL 2021. In fact, we think it would be easier for the invited speakers when no travel is needed.
The only major challenge for running a virtual workshop is time zone coordination, as we have participants from Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

In the past two workshops, we organized our workshops into two sessions:

We are well prepared if our second workshop has to be a virtual conference just like our first workshop at ACL 2020. In fact, we think it would be easier for the invited speakers when no travel is needed. The only major challenge for running a virtual workshop is time zone coordination, as we have participants from Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In 2020, we organized our first workshop into two sessions:

Session | Pacific (PDT)                 | Eastern (EDT)                   | Europe (CET)                  | East Asia (GMT+8)                       | Speakers
:-:     | :-:                           | :-:                             | :-:                           | :-:                                     | :-:
#1      | early morning<br> 7:30–9:30am | late morning<br>10:30am–12:30pm | late afternoon<br>4:30-6:30pm | late evening / night<br>10:30pm-12:30am | Americas/Europe
#2      | late afternoon<br>3-6:30pm    | early evening<br>6-9:30pm       | night time<br>12-3:30am       | early morning<br>6-9:30am               | Asia

As you can see, we tried our best to balance among the four time zones where most of our participants are from.
The only suboptimal slot is Session #2 for European attendees, which was their night time. And we placed the talks
into the slots that are most convenient for the speakers, e.g., we scheduled speakers from North America to Session #1 and those from Asia to Session #2.
For our third workshop, we plan to have it based on this arrangement.

## 7 Shared Task

As we did in our previous workshops, we plan to continue to organize the simultaneous translation shared tasks on Chinese-English and  English-Spanish (or French). We will provide open datasets and evaluation environment. Participants are asked to submit their system description and show demonstration on the workshop. We will enlarge the corpus and extend the language pairs for our third workshop.
