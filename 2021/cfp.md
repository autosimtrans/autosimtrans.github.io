## WORKSHOP OVERVIEW

Simultaneous translation, which performs translation concurrently with the source speech, is widely useful in many scenarios such as international conferences, negotiations, press releases, legal proceedings, and medicine. It combines the AI technologies of machine translation (MT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), is becoming a cutting-edge research field.

As an emerging and interdisciplinary field, simultaneous translation faces many great challenges, and is considered one of the holy grails of AI. As an evidence of the growing importance of simultaneous translation within NLP, one of us (Liang) gave an invited talk at ACL 2019 on the recent advances in this field (see more at [[13]](https://simultrans-demo.github.io/)). This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in machine translation, speech processing, and human interpretation, to discuss recent advances and open challenges of simultaneous translation. including: The architecture of simultaneous translation: traditional pipeline (ASR-MT-TTS) or end-to-end (speech-speech);

- Translation models: robust, high quality, and low latency;
- Data resources: large and high-quality corpora for training simultaneous translation systems.
- Evaluation methods: metrics to evaluate the translation quality and time latency;
- Machine aided simultaneous translation (MAST): improve the efficiency and quality of human interpreters;

Meanwhile, the workshop will also explore challenges for developing practical simultaneous translation systems and will provide opportunity for participants show their products.

We introduce two submission tracks in this workshop: 

- [Research track](/cfp) for research papers;
- [Shared task track](/shared) for systems description papers in the shared task.

## SHARED TASK

We are organizing a simultaneous translation shared task in two directions with different input modes:   
   (a) Chinese-to-English with streaming transcription as input,
   (b) Chinese-to-English with speech audio as input, and 
   (c) English-to-Spanish with streaming transcription as input

There are three competitions in total.

We will provide open datasets and evaluation environment. Participants are encouraged (though not required) to submit their system description papers and present them at the Workshop.

For more time line and dataset information, please see the [Shared Task page](/shared).

## INVITED KEYNOTE SPEAKERS (confirmed)

We have two sets of keynote speakers: 4 from simultaneous translation, and 2 from human interpretation research. We hope this workshop will greatly increase the communication and cross fertilization between the two fields. All these speakers are confirmed.

## SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Our AutoSimTrans Workshop follows the same submission policy from the ACL Submission Guidelines. 

There are two formats: long papers (8 pages content plus unlimited references) and short papers (4 pages contect plus unlimited references). Authors can also upload a separate appendix of unlimited length, which is optional for the reviewers. The final versions of both long and short papers will be given one extra page of content to address reviewers comments. 

For those who participate in the shared task, you are encouraged (though not requried) to submit a system description paper of 4 to 8 pages of content plus unlimited references to AutoSimTrans to describe your system.
